<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello friends!</br></br> It's Diya Sah. I am from Bihar. Yes, I know my name is very cute-thank you! :)</p>

<p> I am a car enthusiast, and I find cars absolutely fascinating. In the future, I dream of owning a Porsche, Lamborghini, Supra or a BMW. I also love listening to music. Currently, my favorite songs are:

<h3>Academic Background</h3>
<p>
  I completed my 10th grade from St. Peter's English Medium School, Purnea, Bihar. 
  For my 12th grade, I attended Bright Career English Medium School, Purnea, Bihar.
  I secured an All India Rank 86,576 in JEE Main 2023, which earned me a seat at NIT Durgapur to pursue B.Tech Degree in Biotechnology. I have completed my first year of college, creating lots of memories and friends. 
  
<h3>Summer Vacation</h3>  
  Currently, I am at home for 2.5 months due to my summer vacation, which started on May 1st and will end on July 15th.
  I miss my friends a lot during this break.
  During that time, I plan to learn Web Development, and hope to enjoy it as much as I enjoy my other interests.</br></br> Have a nice day, Tata! </p>
